		<h2><u>About</u></h2>

		<h4>PDI is a standardized measure of your Personal Digital Health based on your digital usage.</h4>
		<hr>

		<h2>Why is your PDI important?</h2>
		<p>
			It is very important to pay close attention to your relationship with technology. In the age of Digital Over-Consumption, some people may be using technology too much, while others are not using it enough. It can become dangerous if technology is not used optimally, so it is essential that people are able to control their usage. The PDI is an official measure that can help you with "biohacking" which is when you "use science, biology, and self experimentation to take control of and upgrade your body, your mind, and your life" (Dave Asprey). This measurement is useful for self-improvement because it gives you a baseline number that you can use to improve yourself. "A baseline tells you 'how things are.' By carefully observing your current situation, you set yourself up for knowing when and how it changes" (“Get Started”, Quantified Self). It is becoming an increasingly important to prioritize our digital health because technology is becoming is such a central part of our lives. In fact, "smartphone ownership has become a nearly ubiquitous element of teen life: 95% of teens now report they have a smartphone or access to one" (1, Anderson & Jiang).

		<h2>What are the normal ranges for your PDI?</h2>
		<p><strong>Low:</strong> 0-75 <br><br> <strong>Optimal:</strong> 75-125<br> <br><strong>High:</strong> 125-200</p>
		<hr>

		<h2>What are the dangers of Digital Over-Consumption?</h2>
		<div><p>
			The internet can be a dangerous place so it must be used with caution and in moderation. Digital over-consumption on addictive websites like social media should be taken very seriously because studies have shown that "28% of social media users indicated they would have a hard time giving up social media" (1, Smith and Anderson). 
		<br><br>There are many harmful experiences with the use of technology. Therefore, it is crucial to be mindful of the following consequences which have been studied by the Center for Humane Technology. (“Ledger of Harms”, Center for Humane Technology)
			<ul>
        		<li>Attention: Loss of ability to focus without distraction</li>
        		<li>Mental Health: Loneliness, depression, stress, loss of sleep, and even increased risk of suicide</li>
        		<li>Relationships: Less empathy, more confusion and misinterpretation</li>
        		<li>Democracy: Propaganda, lies, an unreliable and noisy space to talk</li>
        		<li>Children: Children face new challenges learning and socializing</li>
    		</ul>
    	</p></div>
    	<hr>

		<h2>What are ways you can reduce your PDI?</h2>
		<div><p>
			There are many ways that you can reduce your PDI and the Center for Humane Tech has many helpful suggestions. (“Take Control”, Center for Humane Tech)
			<ul>
        		<li>Turn off all notifications except from people</li>
        		<li>Go grayscale</li>
        		<li>Try keeping your home screen to tools only</li>
        		<li>Launch other apps by typing</li>
        		<li>Charge your device outside the bedroom</li>
        		<li>Remove social media from your phone</li>
        		<li>Send audio notes or call instead of texting</li>
        		<li>Texting shortcut: Use quick reactions</li>
    		</ul></p>
		</div>
		<hr>

		<h2>What are ways you can increase your PDI?</h2>
		<div><p>
			If you are on the lower end of the scale for PDI, then you can work to improve yourself by using technology more and not being afraid of integrating technology use for purposes like education and productivity. For example, "If you're trying to use a personal computer or are considering using one, remember: Allow yourself to be a little ignorant for a while. Plan to spend some time learning; give the computer a chance to prove itself before you decide you can't use it; take things a step at a time; make sure you read the documentation carefully; and finally, don't forget that you're in charge, not the computer" (LaFrance, “When People Feared Computers”).

		<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
		<div><p>
			It is necessary to be intentional with your digital use and not make mistakes with the implementation. 
			In order to have a healthy effect, it is important to make lifestyle changes instead of using temporary solutions. 
			"A typical culprit, for example, was technologoy restriction rules that were either too vague or too strict...Those who treated this experiment purely as a detox, where the goal was to simply take a break from their digital life before returning to business as usual, also struggled" (62, Newport).
